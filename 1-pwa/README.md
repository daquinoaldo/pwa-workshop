# PWA from scratch - Oct 30, 2019 @ GATE Pisa

## Step 2: web permissions
In this step you find the PWA implemented using the instructions described in the step 0.

Now we will see how to use web permissions to improve our app.  
In this example we will use the location permissions to provide the current location weather to the user.

1. Explore available permissions across different browsers on [What Web Can Do Today](https://whatwebcando.today).
2. Lookout for the geolocation permissions and understand how the code works.
3. Edit `/js/app.js` to work with current location instead of the manually provided one.
4. Check the solution in [2-location](../2-location).
