# PWA from scratch - Oct 30, 2019 @ GATE Pisa

I created this repository for a workshop during the [GDG DevFest Pisa 2019](https://2019.devfest.gdgpisa.it) and then I extended it for a more in-depth talk.

The aim is to transform an existent weather website into a PWA.

The codelab is organized in four steps, divided in 4 folders on this repo.
- [0-skeleton](0-skeleton): the weather website.
- [1-pwa](1-pwa): adds the service worker, the manifest and some headers for Apple/MS devices.
- [2-location](2-location): uses the location permissions.
- [3-ssr](3-ssr): server side rendering.

### How to
- Download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/daquinoaldo/PWA-workshop`.
- Copy the `0-skeleton` folder to a `working` folder to preserve the original one.
- Follow the steps in [0-skeleton/README.md](0-skeleton/README.md).
- Continue the tutorial following the README in each step.
